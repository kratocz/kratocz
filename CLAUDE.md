# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal website for Petr Kratochvíl built with MkDocs Material. The site runs at https://krato.cz/ and is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch within 1 minute via CI/CD.

## Architecture

- **Framework**: MkDocs with Material theme
- **Content**: Markdown files in `/docs/` directory
- **Multilingual**: Czech (`cs/`) and English (`en/`) versions
- **Deployment**: Automated GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages
- **Package Management**: Poetry for Python dependencies

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
./dev                    # Start development server (mkdocs serve)
poetry run mkdocs serve  # Alternative way to serve locally
```

### Build and Deploy
```bash
poetry install           # Install dependencies
poetry run mkdocs build  # Build static site (output in ./site/)
```

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically handles deployment when pushing to `main`.

- Uses Poetry for dependency management
- Python 3.13 is the target version
- Built site is deployed to GitHub Pages
- Site URL: https://krato.cz/ (custom domain)
